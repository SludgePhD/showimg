a funny little image viewer / overlay

### controls

- press escape to exit
- left mouse button: move window, or resize it at its border
- right click: open the OS context menu for the window

### todo

- scrolling while moving the window should change its size
- mipmaps and SPD
- allow marking a rectangle in the image to zoom into?
- there are no good image diff viewers, this could become one
- HDR question mark (I have no use for this, I neither have HDR images nor monitors)
